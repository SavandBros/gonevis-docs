## How do we protect your information?

 We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or
access your personal information.

## Information You Choose to Display Publicly on the GoNevis.com

 Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive
information about themselves in their normal use of the GoNevis.com. This
could occur through use of the optional profile fields, posts or
comments. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly
visible parts of the GoNevis.com, is considered to be public, even if it
would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive.
As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we
don’t control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such
information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally
have with regards to that information. It also increases your chances of
receiving unwanted communications, like spam.

be covered by any privacy policies they may have. Please be sure to read

can't be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally
identifying information.
