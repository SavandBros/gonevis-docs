# Mature Content

We do permit mature content on GoNevis.com, including text, images and
videos that contain nudity, offensive language, and mature subject material.
However, blogs that contain such content must be marked as Mature in our
system.

If you are publishing a blog that you expect will contain content that is
intended for mature audiences, we ask that you provide us the courtesy of
reporting your blog or website to us..

A blog or website that is marked as Mature is excluded from public areas of
the GoNevis.com service. This means:

  * It will not appear in the Reader or other tag listings
  * It will not appear in Top Blogs listings, recent posts, or related posts listings on other blogs
  * The blog's users cannot use that URL as a link in their GoNevis.com Forums profile

Mature blogs and their owners are permitted to utilize all other aspects of
GoNevis.com. We do not suspend blogs solely for the presence of mature
content and there are no interstitials or other "age gates" on GoNevis.com.

However, there are limitations to the mature content permitted on our service.
Please don't:

  * Post visual depictions of sexually explicit acts (such as, but not limited to, images, videos, and drawings) that can be considered pornographic;
  * Post links or ads to adult-oriented affiliate networks, such as pornography site signups;
  * Post links, text, or images promoting or advertising escort or erotic services;
  * Post images of extreme violence or gore without associated context or commentary;
  * Post images of child pornography;
  * Post content that promotes pedophilia, such as blogs with galleries of images of children where the images, content surrounding the images, or the intent of the blog is sexually suggestive.

Blogs found to be hosting the above material will be suspended. In cases of
child pornography, we will report all incidences to the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children and fully cooperate with law enforcement.
