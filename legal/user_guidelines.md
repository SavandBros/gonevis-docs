# User Guidelines

GoNevis.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience
spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and
our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions
without us censoring or endorsing them. That being said, there are a few
categories of content and behavior that we don't permit because we consider
them harmful to the community.

To be transparent about what is and isn't allowed on your site, we've put
together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn't allowed
on GoNevis.com.

**Illegal content and conduct.**

- **Pornography.**: We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts. Nudity, in and of itself, is [fine]({% url 'basement:mature_content'%}).

- **Technologically harmful content.**: Please don't upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.

- **Impersonation.**: Don't claim to be a person or organization you're not. (Parody and satire are ok though!)
- **Directly threatening material.** Do not post direct and realistic
threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence--or death--against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn't mean that we'll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.
- **Posting private information.**: Don't share someone's without their consent. This includes collecting sensitive information in Contact Forms such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.
- **Hotlinking to GoNevis.com.**: Other than Videos, your GoNevis.com site shouldn't host files that will only be used on other sites.
- **Spam or machine-generated content.** You know what this is, but in general, sites such as those primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing aren't cool. We don't want you to pollute the web outside of GoNevis.com either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your site, even if it's not on GoNevis.com.

----

Bear in mind that these are just guidelines -- **interpretations are up to
us**. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

If you believe a GoNevis.com site has violated our Terms of
Service or any of these policies, please report the site. We review and
investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will
depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and
the type of violation. We may also contact the site owner to inform him/her of
the complaint.
